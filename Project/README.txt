Hello :)

To run the entire program, all you need to do is navigate
to the pyRun folder and call python3 pyRun.py 

This will generate all the solution files as well as some console output.

Solution to case 5 is stored in (X.dat), the rest can be found in x_piv# and x_nopiv# depending on the case :)

Thanks for a great quarter!
